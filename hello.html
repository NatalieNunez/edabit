      My name is Natalie and I am coding my <em>first</em> "website" so I can
      learn how to code and hopefully become a full stack developer one day.

      Wish me luck! My instructor just said that the knowledge I have in html is
      as if i was coding in the 1990's... so I really got a <b>long</b> way to
      go!
